# ChatBot
121COM Chat Bot Group 2
Discord MovieBot

This ChatBot requires the usage and installation of Discordpy and IMDbpy.

Discordpy also requires the creation of a Bot using the Discord developer portal, with which the Bot ID is then placed into the list of users at the bottom of the discordserver.py code. The Discord platform is then used to interact.
